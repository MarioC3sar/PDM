# Welcome to your Expo app 👋

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

### Android on this machine

If you see `Failed to resolve the Android SDK path`, export the SDK path before running Expo:

```bash
export ANDROID_HOME=/usr/lib/android-sdk
export ANDROID_SDK_ROOT=/usr/lib/android-sdk
export PATH="$PATH:$ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools"
```

Then run:

```bash
npm run android
```

Note: an SDK path alone is not enough. You still need either:

- a connected Android device with USB debugging enabled (`adb devices` should list it), or
- an Android emulator/AVD installed and started.

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
